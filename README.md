#  Static Web Pages Clone Project

##  Project Overview

This project showcases my **front-end development skills** by recreating the **home pages of popular real-world websites** using **pure HTML and CSS**.

All pages are **static** (no backend or JavaScript frameworks) and focus on **pixel-perfect design**, clean structure, and reusable styling practices.
